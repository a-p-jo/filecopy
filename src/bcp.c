 * Hence, we will have to check datatypes during pre-processing , to conditionally compile with correct data types.

 * Conditional Compilation / Pre-processor checks :
 * 	1. C standard function ftell() returns the offset as a long. Check if a long is at least 64-bits. If yes, use ftell().
 * 	2. Else, identify the platform .
 * 		a) If Windows, use microsoft's _ftelli64(), guaranteed to return 64-bit offsets.
 *		b) If UNIX/POSIX, we must be in a 32-bit environment. 
 *		   As per POSIX, if we #define the offset-bits macro to 64 and then use ftello(), we'll get a 64-bit offset.
 *		c) If neither, this is some obscure/rare (presumably 32-bit) environment, #undef the PRINT_PROGRESS.
